** Done should change btnPlay to Play image

- Routines
  - Soccer Touches
  - Sun Salutation

- Play Routine activity
  + Disable/Hide Next/Prev button
  + Show Duration of full Routine
  + Should we just pass Routine.name and have Routines be a Hashtable?

* Pose implements Drawable so we can have list of Drawable for Poses or Patterns
  - multiple Poses requires an offset for each
  - Extents
    - use Rectangle2D.Float?
    - body parts calculate Extents in constructor, Pose does a Union.

- Poses
  * Calf Stretches from Down Dog
  * Safety Jacks use 2 Poses
  - Drawing improvements
    - "High Knee": add arms
  + Props
    - Strap/Band
    - Block
    - Ball
  - ProfilePose use Z to show depth in 3D?

* Chime
  * Playable audio
- Notifications

- Startup
  + MainActivity calls generatePoses() every time it runs; It passes serialized Routine to PlayRoutineActivity.
    - Derive a class from Application that overrides onCreate() calling super.onCreate().

- Text-to-Speech
  - Bluetooth Headset button pauses?
- Paid app for adding new Routine

- Log Activity
  - Saving to Google Doc or persistent storage
